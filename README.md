# NZK Drawing Tool :pencil:

### Shared across nzk-edu and nzk-show

The drawing tool uses the Button and Icon UI components from nzk-edu. This repo has been set up with copies of these components and necessary assets in a folder called 'UI' so that Storybook works. However, when this repo is imported as a package into nzk-edu or nzk-show, the path names should relate to components and assets in the respective repos.
